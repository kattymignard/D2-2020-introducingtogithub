  <h1>WHO'S AESOP ?</h1>

  <h2>The legend</h2>
<p> The legend of Aesop is known to us from the story of Maximus Planude, a thirteenth-century Byzantine scholar, who popularized a Life of Aesop from material that probably dates back to the first century. The text comes from various traditions, some ancient, others from the Roman period. The most important borrowing is the account of Aesop's life in Babylon, which is a transposition of the account of the life of Ahiqar, who was circulating in Syria at that time.9 The text is based on material from the Roman period. 9 Jean de La Fontaine adapted this story and placed it at the head of his collection of fables under the title The Life of Aesop the Phrygian.


The Slave Aesop in the Service of Two Priests, by F. Barlow, 1687
According to this story:

"Aesop was the ugliest of his contemporaries; he had a pointed head, a camard-like nose, a very short neck, protruding lips, a black complexion, hence his name, which means nigger; plump, knobby, stooped, he surpassed Homer's Thersite in ugliness; but, worse still, he was slow to express himself and his speech was confused and inarticulate. »</p>

<p>These caricatural features were enough for some authors to speculate on his negritude.

11 According to legend, Aesop, having dreamed that Fortune had loosened his tongue, woke up one day cured of his stuttering. Bought by a slave trader, he arrives at the home of a Samoan philosopher, Xanthos, with whom he competes with tricks and good words.

Finally freed, he then goes to King Croesus to try to safeguard the independence of Samos. He succeeds in his embassy by telling the king a fable. He then puts himself at the service of the "king of Babylon", who takes great pleasure in the enigmas of the fabulist. He also solves with brilliance the enigmas which would have posed to his master the king of Egypt.


The death of Aesop, illustration of a Spanish Ysopet of 1489.
Travelling in Greece, he stops in Delphi, where, according to legend, he would have mocked the inhabitants of the place because, instead of cultivating the land, they lived on offerings made to the god. In revenge, the Delphians accused him of stealing sacred objects and sentenced him to death. To defend himself, Aesop tells them two fables, The Frog and the Rat and The Eagle and the Carbot, but he does nothing about it and dies precipitously from the rocks of Phædryads.</p>

  <h2>A literary figure</h2>
  <p> Aesop's fables are short prose stories without literary pretensions. It is almost certain that he did not write them. The fable existed before Aesop, but Aesop became so popular because of his good words that he was made the "father of the fable": "Since the Greek does not have a specific term to designate the fable, the name of Aesop served as a catalyst, all the more so since every science, every technique, every literary genre had to be linked to an "inventor". This explains, in part, why Aesop so quickly became the emblematic figure of the fable.
  </p>

  <p> The first collection of fables attributed to Aesop was compiled by the philosopher Demetrios of Phalerus around 325 BC. This lost work has given rise to countless versions. One of these has been preserved as a set of manuscripts probably dating from the first century, a collection called Augustana. It is to this one that we refer when we speak today of "Aesop's Fables". It includes more than 500 fables, all in prose, among which are the most popular, such as The Raven and the Fox, The Hare and the Tortoise, The Woodcutter and Death, The Wind and the Sun, and so on. It is likely that the name Aesop was used to group together all sorts of stories that had previously been passed around orally and which had common characteristics.
  </p>

  <h2>Fables, an oral tradition</h2>
  <p>During his life as a slave, Aesop fights incessantly against his master Xanthos, whose name means "Blond". The historical reality of the prodigious destiny of this stammering and deformed former slave who managed to get himself freed and came to advise kings through his ability to solve enigmas has often been questioned.

"Aesop's entire life story is based on the theme of laughter, the good joke through which the weak, exploited, takes over the masters, the powerful. In this sense, Aesop is a forerunner of the anti-hero, ugly, despised, with no initial power, but who manages to get away with it by his ability to decipher enigmas. ».</p>

<p>Aesop was already very popular in classical times, as shown by the fact that Socrates himself is said to have spent his last moments in prison before his death putting into verse fables by this author. The philosopher would have explained it to the philosopher Cébès in the following way: "A poet must take myths as his subject matter [...] So I chose myths at hand, these fables of Aesop that I knew by heart, by chance of the encounter. »

The poet Diogenes Laërce even attributed a fable to Socrates, which began as follows: "One day, Aesop told the inhabitants of Corinth that virtue should not be subjected to the judgment of the people. "This is a precept nowadays typically associated with the philosopher rather than the fabulist. Socrates probably used the name Aesop to pass his precepts through apologists.</p>

<p> The Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, “You ungrateful fellows! Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?” </p>
